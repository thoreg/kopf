# Custom Resources

## Custom Resource Definition

Let us define a CRD (custom resource definition) for our object:

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: ephemeralvolumeclaims.kopf.dev
spec:
  scope: Namespaced
  group: kopf.dev
  names:
    kind: EphemeralVolumeClaim
    plural: ephemeralvolumeclaims
    singular: ephemeralvolumeclaim
    shortNames:
      - evcs
      - evc
  versions:
    - name: v1
      served: true
      storage: true
      schema:
        openAPIV3Schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            spec:
              type: object
              x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true
            status:
              type: object
              x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true
```

Note the short names: they can be used as the aliases on the command line,
when getting a list or an object of that kind.

And apply the definition to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f crd.yaml
```

If you want to revert this operation (e.g., to try it again):

```bash
kubectl delete crd ephemeralvolumeclaims.kopf.dev
kubectl delete -f crd.yaml
```

## Custom Resource Objects

Now, we can already create the objects of this kind, apply it to the cluster,
modify and delete them. Nothing will happen, since there is no implemented
logic behind the objects yet.

Letâ€™s make a sample object:

```yaml
apiVersion: kopf.dev/v1
kind: EphemeralVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-claim
```

This is the minimal yaml file needed, with no spec or fields inside.
We will add them later.

Apply it to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f obj.yaml
```

Get a list of the existing objects of this kind with one of the commands:

```bash
kubectl get EphemeralVolumeClaim
kubectl get ephemeralvolumeclaims
kubectl get ephemeralvolumeclaim
kubectl get evcs
kubectl get evc
```

Please note that we can use the short names as specified
on the custom resource definition.
